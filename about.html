        <div>Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the "Universal Genius" or "Renaissance Man",
            an individual of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination", and he is widely considered
            one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner,
            the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and "his mind and personality
            seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci notes that while there is much
            speculation regarding his life and personality, his view of the world was logical rather than mysterious, and
            that the empirical methods he employed were unorthodox for his time. Reference: Wikipedia</div>
